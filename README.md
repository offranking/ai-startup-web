## ai-startup-webs
## This is my first repository as a DevOps Engineer at Darey.io


 
 Mini Project - Basic Git Commands.
 I set up this Git project by clicking the '+' icon at the top right corner of the GitHub interface, then selecting 'New Repository.

In Stage 2, I named the repository ai-startup-web and initialized it with a README file to provide a starting point for documentation and collaboration.

 I created a folder named gitt-project and used the cd command to navigate into it. Then, I used the git clone command along with the copied HTTPS URL to clone my GitHub repository into the folder
